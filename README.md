# CodeReviewCore

The hardest things in code review are

- Too many changes happen
- Too deep knowledge required
- Too many contexts referred

We fix them all.

## Features

- AST-diffing based on difftastic engine (like SemanticDiff)
- Hunks regrouped, seems stacked
- Natural file-tree view integration, like reviewing on VS Code
